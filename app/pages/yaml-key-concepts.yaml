    In Fluwy, YAML is used to describe UI components in a clean, human-readable way. This guide will explain several key concepts in Fluwy, including how to use array styles to avoid duplicated keys, and how to use classes effectively with components.

    ## Avoiding Duplicated Keys in YAML Files
    YAML does not support repeated keys within the same object. For example, if you attempt to use two `<div>` elements under the same parent component using object syntax, you'll encounter an error:

    ```yaml
    column:
      div: ...
      div: ...  # <- This is not allowed in YAML
    ```

    To overcome this, you can use an array style:

    ```yaml
    column:
      - div: ...
      - div: ...
    ```

    In this format, each element is part of an array, indicated by the `-` symbol. This ensures there are no duplicate keys and provides a flexible way to manage multiple nested components.

    ## Using Classes and Content with Components
    In Fluwy, every component has implicit `class` and `content` properties that can be used for styling and content organization. Here's how you can use these properties effectively:

    - If you do not need to add classes to your components, you can directly nest content under the component, omitting the `content` property for simplicity.
    - If you need to add a class to a component, use the `class` property explicitly and use the `content` property to define the nested content.

    ### Example
    Consider the following scenario where you want to add a class to a `column` containing multiple `div` elements:

    ```yaml
    column:
      class: my-column-class
      content:
        - div: ...
        - div: ...
    ```

    In this example:
    - The `class` property is used to apply styles to the `column`.
    - The `content` property contains an array of child components, ensuring a clear and organized structure.

    If you do not need to use a class, you can simplify the structure by omitting the `content` property:

    ```yaml
    column:
      - div: ...
      - div: ...
    ```

    This keeps your YAML code concise while still allowing for multiple child components.

    ## Summary
    - YAML does not allow duplicated keys in objects; use array style (`-`) to add multiple elements under the same parent.
    - In Fluwy, components have implicit `class` and `content` properties.
    - Omit `content` for simpler nesting when no classes are needed.
    - Use `class` and `content` explicitly when adding styles to components.

    By using these patterns, you can keep your YAML code clean, organized, and free of errors related to duplicated keys.
