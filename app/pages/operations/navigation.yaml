      ## goto
      The `goto` operation is used to navigate to a specific route. It can be used as both server and client operations.
      It accepts a string parameter with the route to navigate to. Example:

      ```yaml
      goto: /home
      ```

      It also accepts variables from the context to be parsed into the route. Example:

      ```yaml
      goto: /user/${id}
      ```

      If you use a full URL string to it, it will also work and it will open the URL in a new tab if you are in the browser,
      or it will redirect the user to the URL if the operation was ran on the server. Example:

      ```yaml
      goto: https://example.com
      ```
