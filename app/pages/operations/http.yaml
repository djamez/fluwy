      ## POST Operation
      The `post` operation is used to make a POST request to a given URL and inject the response into the context of
      your operation chain. This is the overall structure of the `post` operation:

      ```yaml
      post:
        url: string
        data: object from context
        on_error: list of operations to handle the response when the http status code >= 300
      ```
