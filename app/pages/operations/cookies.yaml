      ## set_cookie

      The `set_cookie` operation is used to set a cookie in the browser. It's similar to the `set_auth_token` operation
      but it doesn't set the token in the context and some other things. It accepts an object with key-value pairs where 
      the key is the name of the cookie and the value is the value of the cookie. This is useful when you want to set 
      multiple cookies in the browser. Example:

      ```yaml
      set_cookie:
        item-1: value-1
        item-2: value-2
      ```

      The cookies also accept object params where you can specify the `value` (required), `duration` (in seconds) or 
      `expires_at` (ISO 8601 datetime string or unix timestamp). Example:

      ```yaml
      set_cookie:
        item-1:
          value: value-1
          duration: 3600 # in seconds
        item-2:
          value: value-2
          expires_at: 2023-01-01
      ```

      > **Note**: If you don't specify `duration` or `expires_at`, the cookie will never expire. Never set both of them
      at the same time, otherwise you will get an unexpected behavior.

      You can also specify a path to be resolved from the context data. Example:

      ```yaml
      set_cookie:
        item-1:
          value: response.data.value
          duration: response.data.duration # in seconds
          # or
          expires_at: response.data.expires_at
      ```

      ## unset_cookie

      The `unset_cookie` operation is used to remove a cookie from the browser. It accepts a string parameter with the
      name of the cookie to remove. Example:

      ```yaml
      unset_cookie: item-1
      ```

      ## remove_cookie

      The `remove_cookie` operation is an alias for the `unset_cookie` operation which means it's just another way to use
      the `unset_cookie` operation.
